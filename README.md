OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
PROJECT--- BASIC CALCULATOR PROGRAM 
OVERVIEW: This Python program is designed to act as a simple command-line calculator. It prompts the user to input two numerical values and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). After the user selects an operation, the program performs the calculation and displays the result. The program demonstrates key Python concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, basic functions, and error handling. The division operation includes a check for division by zero to prevent runtime errors.

The calculator is intended for educational purposes, allowing users to understand how to perform basic mathematical operations in Python.
The primary objectives of this basic calculator program are:

Understand user input:

Learn how to prompt users for input and convert their responses into usable data types (e.g., float for numbers).

Use functions:

Define functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to make the code modular and reusable.

Implement conditional logic:

Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to allow the user to choose which operation to perform based on their input.

Perform basic mathematical operations:

Implement simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
